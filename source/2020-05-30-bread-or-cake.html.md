title: A Bread or a Cake?

Tanja - the company co-founder and my spouse, makes bread. She has been doing
that for the last 10 years. She's always using the same, simple recipe. The word
"recipe" is inaccurate, since she doesn't use the same ingredients every time.
Sometimes she uses one type of flour. Sometimes 2 or 3. It's a simple procedure
that tolerates different ingredients and conditions.

It's not the best bread in the world. But, it's very tasty, it's always fresh
and we love it!

A few years ago, I wanted to learn how to make a bread. But, I wanted something
different. So I went online and found a recipe that was interesting. I used 3
types of flour - two for the middle and one darker for the crust. And some seeds
for the inside and other on the crust. You had to spend time working on the
dough, so that it's smooth and elastic. And you had to repeat that a few times.

It took me a while to make it. But, in the end, I had a solid loaf. It didn't
look the same as in the article and it probably didn't taste the same, but I was
happy.

Then Tanja tasted it. She said it tastes fine. But, she also said that I can't
expect to spend an hour or so every couple of days making a bread. She said that
that's not actually a bread. It's a cake. For her - even though it looked like a
bread and it tasted like a bread, if it takes more than 10 minutes of effort,
it's not a bread. It's a cake.

I stopped looking for fancy bread articles after that.

But, I still think about what she said. The same test is useful for evaluating
other things, too. Like programming languages, libraries, solutions, furniture,
kitchen appliances, clothes, etc:

1. Is this something I will use daily, occasionally or in special occasions?
2. Is it easy to use? How much effort does it need?
3. Is it easy to maintain? Does it need a lot of ceremony?
4. Is it a bread or a cake?

There's a time and a place for a cake. But for every day, I choose bread.

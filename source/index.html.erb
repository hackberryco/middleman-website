      I have a Rails application and need help with the maintenance.

      We got this. We work with Rails for the last 6 years. Some applications
      we maintain are older than 12. Released before Rails 1.0! We find joy
      in keeping a useful system in a good shape.<br/>

      I have a slow Rails application and want to make it faster.

      This happens. There's often not enough time to invest in performance. But
      performance matters. We use a set of solid, industry standard tools to
      find performance bottlenecks in your application. Low hanging fruits and
      high benefits first!

      I need help with something else.

      Is it on the Web? We can probably do it. We helped our clients automate
      workflows, launch static and Wordpress websites, implement designs
      and Wordpress themes. Even if it's not our core expertise, if you're our
      client, we'll help any way we can.
